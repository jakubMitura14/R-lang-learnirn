A retrospective sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region							
of the Western Cape, South Africa. There are roughly two controls per							
case of CHD. Many of the CHD positive men have undergone blood							
pressure reduction treatment and other programs to reduce their risk							
factors after their CHD event. In some cases the measurements were							
made after these treatments. These data are taken from a larger							
dataset, described in  Rousseauw et al, 1983, South African Medical							
Journal.
